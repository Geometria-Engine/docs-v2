# Introduction to Physics.

Welcome to the second tutorial of the engine's documentation!

In here you're going to learn about physics, and at the final chapter you're gonna be able to make your first "platformer character movement"!

But first, let's take a closer look at the basics and start slowly before jumping to the end. Don't worry! This will be pretty straight-forward like the "Hello World" tutorial!

# Introducing the components.

When it comes to Physics, we have **two key components** that are extremely useful, the [**Rigidbody**](/api/Physics/Rigidbody.md) and the **Collisions**.

The most basic one of them all is the [**BoxCollider**](/api/Physics/BoxCollider.md), so let's start from there.
