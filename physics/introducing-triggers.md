# Introducing Triggers

Welcome to a new chapter of the Physics tutorial!

This time, we're going to take a look at **Triggers**!

You *might* be asking yourself...

## What is a Trigger?

Well, a Trigger is basically a collision, which only goal is to check if other collisions are inside it.

**Other collisions can't collide with it, they only go through it**, meaning that can't act as something like a wall or a floor.

***But...*** it can act as an invisible activator, like an invisible cube that opens a door, or something that activates a trap!

Let me show an example in form of a drawing:

**This is "Bob", say hi to Bob! :D**. **Bob** needs to go through the door, because he needs to go to work:
