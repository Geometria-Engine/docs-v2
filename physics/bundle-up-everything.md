# Bundle Up Everything

Hello! Welcome to the last chapter of this wonderful Physics tutorial!

Now its time to bundle everything and turn it into a **game**!

We're going to do... **A 2D PLATFORMER** as our final excercise! :D

Don't worry, its not going to be hard at all, in fact, you already coded **80%** of what its needed thanks to these tutorials!

**Let's get started**! :D

## The Plan

So, the Plan basically is to make a simple platformer, that has the **yellow player**, **a green goal** and of course, some platforms.

The objetive is quite simple: Move and jump to one of the other platforms and reach the goal.

And once the player hits the goal, it'll teleport back down.

**Quite simple! :D**
