# Geometria Reference API

### Welcome to the Geometria Reference API!

In here, you'll have all of the components you need documented! *(Not 100% documented, but most of it :))*

You can find all of the classes, structs, functions, values, etc. to help you make your game/app!

To start looking for what you need, you can look at the left bar or here at the bottom, and look for the APIs you need :D.
